Environment: Python 2.7

After a vulnerability scan, nexpose will generate a report which contains too much details about the vulnerabilities. It is not helpful at all since nobody would like to read a 500+ pages report. To make life easier for both users and infosec team, I wrote this script to simplify the scan report generated by Nexpose.

Original Report for 69.173.125.60 is the report generated directly by Nexpose
Simplified_Report is the report generated by my script.
~600 pages -> 2 pages

Run simplify_scan_report.py, you can also set the severity level based on cvss, above 3 is "critical" and "severe" vulnerabilities. 
test.pdf is the simplified report. 

xml_[IP].xml is the original data which can be exported from Nexpose after the scan.
The script only grab information that is useful and necessary for the user to fix vulerabilities.

FOLLOW UP:
Users love the new report! lol
