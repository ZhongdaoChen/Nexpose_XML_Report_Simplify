# Nexpose_XML_Report_Simplify
The purpose is to simplify the scan report generated by Nexpose. I use ElementTree to process the xml file. 

Original Report for 69.173.125.60 is the report generated directly by Nexpose
Simplified_Report is the report generated by my script.
~600 pages -> 2 pages

Run simplify_scan_report.py, you can also set the severity level, above 3 is "critical" and "severe" vulnerabilities. 
test.pdf is the simplified report. 
xml_[IP].xml is the original data which can be exported from Nexpose after the scan.
The script only grab information that is useful and necessary for the user to fix vulerabilities.
