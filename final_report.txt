Scan report for 69.173.112.38

1 :Database Open Access  -- Severity: 5
Description: 
 The database allows any remote system the ability to connect to it. It is recommended to limit direct access to trusted systems because databases 
 may contain sensitive data, and new vulnerabilities and exploits are discovered routinely for them. For this reason, it is a violation of PCI 
 DSS section 1.3.6 to have databases listening on ports accessible from the Internet, even when protected with secure authentication mechanisms.
Solution:
 Configure the database server to only allow access to trusted systems. For example, the PCI DSS standard requires you to place the database in an 
 internal network zone, segregated from the DMZ

2 :Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability  -- Severity: 6
Description: 
The Web application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS), which allows attackers to take advantage of Web server scripts to inject JavaScript 
 or HTML code that is executed on the client-side browser. This vulnerability is often caused by server-side scripts written in languages such 
 as PHP, ASP, .NET, Perl or Java, which do not adequately filter data sent along with page requests or by vulnerable HTTP servers. This 
 malicious code appears to come from your Web application when it runs in the browser of an unsuspecting user.
An attacker can do the following damage with an expoloit script:
access other sites inside another client's private intranet
steal another client's cookie(s)
modify another client's cookie(s)
steal another client's submitted form data
modify another client's submitted form data before it reaches the server
submit a form to your Web application on the user's behalf that modifies passwords or other application data
The two most common methods of attack are:
Having a user click a URL link sent in an e-mail
Having a user click a URL link while visiting a Web site
In both scenarios, the URL will generally link to the trusted site, but will contain additional data that is used to trigger the XSS attack.
Note that SSL connectivity does not protect against this issue.
Solution:
Audit the affected url and other similar dynamic pages or scripts that could be relaying untrusted malicious data from the user input. In general, 
 the following practices should be followed while developing dynamic web content:
Explicitly set the character set encoding for each page generated by the web server
Identify special characters
Encode dynamic output elements
Filter specific characters in dynamic elements
Examine cookies
 For more information on the above practices, read the following CERT advisory:
http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_mitigation.html
For ASP.NET applications, the validateRequest attribute can be added to the page or the web.config. For example:
 <%@ Page ... validateRequest="true" %> OR <system.web> <pages validateRequest="true" /> </system.web>
In addition, all dynamic content should be HTML encoded using HTTPUtility.HTMLEncode.
For PHP applications, input data should be validated using functions such as strip_tags and utf8_decode. Dynamic content should be HTML encoded 
 using htmlentities.
For Perl applications, input data should be validated whenever possible using regular expressions. Dynamic content should be HTML encoded using 
 HTML::Entities::encode or Apache::Util::html_encode (when using mod_perl).

3 :Missing HttpOnly Flag From Cookie  -- Severity: 5
Description: 
HttpOnly is an additional flag included in a Set-Cookie HTTP response header. If supported by the browser, using the HttpOnly flag when generating 
 a cookie helps mitigate the risk of client side script accessing the protected cookie. If a browser that supports HttpOnly detects a cookie 
 containing the HttpOnly flag, and client side script code attempts to read the cookie, the browser returns an empty string as the result. This causes 
 the attack to fail by preventing the malicious (usually XSS) code from sending the data to an attacker's website.
Solution:
For each cookie generated by your web-site, add the "HttpOnly" flag to the cookie. For example:
 Set-Cookie: <name>=<value>[; <Max-Age>=<age>] [; expires=<date>][; domain=<domain_name>] [; path=<some_path>][; secure][; HttpOnly]

4 :Click Jacking  -- Severity: 4
Description: 
 Clickjacking, also known as a UI redress attack, is a method in which an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking 
 a button or link on a page other than the one they believe they are clicking. Thus, the attacker is "hijacking" clicks meant for one page and 
 routing the user to an illegitimate page.
Solution:
 Send the HTTP response headers with X-Frame-Options that instruct the browser to restrict framing where it is not allowed.

5 :Blind SQL Injection  -- Severity: 9
Description: 
Web applications usually store information in a SQL server in order to, for example, show them to other users. When the application developer uses 
 unvalidated user controlled variables as part of a SQL query; a SQL injection or Blind SQL injection vulnerability is being introduced into the application.
When an attacker executes SQL Injection attacks, sometimes the server responds with error messages from the database server complaining that 
 the SQL Query's syntax is incorrect. Blind SQL injection is identical to normal SQL Injections except that when an attacker attempts to 
 exploit an application, rather then getting a potentially useful error message, they get a generic page specified by the developer instead. 
 This makes exploiting a potential Blind SQL Injection attack more difficult but not impossible. An attacker can still retrieve 
 valuable information and potentially execute operating system commands by asking a series of True and False questions through SQL statements.
Solution:
Ensure that the Web application validates and encodes user input before using it in a SQL query.
Details:
Found blind SQL injection on
http://69.173.112.38:443/do-forgot-password.html
Parameter f_email_name behaves differently with the following payloads:
test@example.com' OR '83244'='83244
test@example.com' AND '83244'='83245

6 :Form action submits sensitive data in the clear  -- Severity: 4
Description: 
A web form contains fields with data that is probably sensitive in nature. This form data is submitted over an unencrypted connection, which could 
 allow hackers to sniff the network and view the data in plaintext.
Solution:
Enable the HTTPS protocol on the server. Change the "action" URL of the form tag to use the HTTPS protocol ("https://...") instead of just the HTTP 
 protocol ("http://..."). All sensitive data should be sent over HTTPS instead of over HTTP.
Details:

7 :Autocomplete enabled for sensitive HTML form fields  -- Severity: 4
Description: 
The Web form contains passwords or other sensitive text fields for which the browser auto-complete feature is enabled. Auto-complete stores completed 
 form field and passwords locally in the browser, so that these fields are filled automatically when the user visits the site again.
Sensitive data and passwords can be stolen if the user's system is compromised.
Note, however, that form auto-complete is a non-standard, browser-side feature that each browser handles differently. Opera, for example, disregards 
 the feature, requiring the user to enter credentials for each Web site visit.
Solution:
For each sensitive field in the HTML, set the "autocomplete" attribute to "off". For example:
 <input type="password" autocomplete="off" name="pw">
If there are many fields, it may be faster to set the "autocomplete" attribute to "off" in the outer <form> tag. For example:
 <form action="/login.jsp" autocomplete="off" name="pw"> <input type="password" name="pw"> </form>
Details:
Form with action http://69.173.112.38:443/fba.shtml does not explicitly disable autocomplete for the following sensitive fields: password

8 :MySQL mysqlaccess Temporary File Symlink Attack  -- Severity: 5
Description: 
Certain versions of the 'mysqlaccess' program shipped with MySQL are vulnerable to a symlink attack because the temporary files used are easy to 
 predict. As a result, a local attacker can overwrite any file which the calling process has write access to.
Solution:
As of January 25th, 2005, there does not exist an official fix from the MySQL development team. However, several vendors have provided their own patches:
Debian has released fixes to their stable (woody) and unstable (sid) branches: http://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-647
Details:
The following file versions were found to be less than 2.07: /usr/bin/mysqlaccess

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9 :World writable files exist  -- Severity: 4
Description: 
World writable files were found on the system. A file that can be written by any user on the system could be a serious security flaw.
Solution:
For each world-writable file, determine whether there is a good reason for it to be world writable. If not, remove world write permissions for the file.
Details:
The following world writable files were found.
/tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach/_notifier
/tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach/_attachlock
/tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach/_master
